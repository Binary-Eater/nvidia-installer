2004-01-12 version 1.0.6

    * Add support for installing on Linux 2.6 kernels.

    * Deprecate the "--kernel-include-path" commandline option,
      in favor of "--kernel-source-path".

    * Added "--no-rpms" option to disable the check for conflicting rpms.

2003-12-16 version 1.0.5

    * Have nvidia-installer perforce a gcc version check itself (ie:
      check that the current compiler and the compiler used to compile
      the kernel are a close enough match to build the NVIDIA kernel module.

    * Remove conflicting libraries in /usr/X11R6/lib/tls/

    * Add new option "--no-abi-note".

2003-09-23 version 1.0.4

    * When searching for a precompiled kernel interface, also look in
      /lib/modules/precompiled/`uname -r`/nvidia/gfx/, and in
      any directory specified by the new commandline option
      "--precompiled-kernel-interfaces-path".

    * When searching for a precompiled kernel interface, ensure that
      the version number stamped in the precompiled kernel interface
      matches that of the driver we are installing.

    * Add tls_test binaries for IA64

    * Rewrite the tls_test to more closely mimic the tls usage
      pattern of the OpenGL driver: dlopen() a dso that uses the
      local-exec access model to access a thread local variable.

2003-08-13 version 1.0.3

    * Add new commandline option "--kernel-module-only" to allow
      users to install additional kernel modules on top of an
      existing installation.

    * Add new commandline options "--no-network" and "--no-backup".

    * Warn users if they are installing while in runlevel 1.

    * Install a libGL.la file.

    * Fix SEGV triggered when the signal handler called ui->close().

    * When the user does not accept the license agreement,
      print "License not accepted.  Aborting installation." with
      ui_message(), rather than ui_log() so that the user gets this
      feedback displayed on screen, rather than just printed to the
      log file.

2003-06-24 version 1.0.2

    * Add new .run/installer option "--add-this-kernel"; when this option
      is specified, the installer will build a precompiled kernel
      interface for the running kernel, and the .run file will be
      repackaged to include this new precompiled kernel interface.

    * If we are building for a non-running kernel, specify that
      kernel name on the depmod commandline line (see depmod(8)
      manpage for details).  Patch provided by Nigel Spowage
      <Nigel.Spowage@energis.com>

    * Only execute `/usr/bin/chrc.config` if the distro is SuSE or
      UnitedLinux *and* the file exists.  Patch from Stefan Dirsch
      <sndirsch@suse.de>

2003-04-24 version 1.0.1

    * Do not install the NVIDIA OpenGL header files by default;
      they will be installed in the documentation directory,
      and can be optionally installed on the system with the
      "--opengl-headers" commandline option.

    * Abort installation if any X server is currently running
      (even if it is not using an NVIDIA driver).  We check if an
      X server is running by checking for existence of the files
      /tmp/.X[0-7]-lock.

    * Add a signal handler to tls_test to avoid dumping core files,
      and prevent error messages from being printed to stdout.

2003-03-31 version 1.0

    * Initial Release.
